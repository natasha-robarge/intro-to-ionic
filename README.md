# Welcome to Sweetly Fit!

Sweetly Fit is an ionic practice app where you can share sweet recipes, workouts, and more with
your fellow fit pals. You can even find new inspiration by following people's Pinterest.

**NOTE: This will not be added to a project idea list yet. This is simply for practice with Ionic, Cordova, and Firebase**

## Updates to Sweetly Fit

It's being made right now!! Haha, so no professional fake updates yet. Look forward to it soon though.

## Ionic / Firebase Apps

Go get Ionic and look through their documentation. Also, check out Firebase. It seems cool.
I just don't know if it's used in the industry and I don't know React Native... yet ;D
